All rise!
Judged like a jury but in a trial.
No respect for the young and innocent.

Guilty!
Now shut the doors and then open fire.
So fail to make the connection and lose beauty in the mouth of rejection.

Can't we understand that no life is out of our hands?

Suffocation and the fear of living setting in so let go.
Let go before he lets go.
Patience is wearing thin and leaving him so let go.
Let go before he lets go of this life.

I wonder what goes on?
Before he lets go he says.

Send an angel to pull me from the hell below.
This weight is far too much to hold.
And this body doesn't feel like home.
Send an angel, I feel I'm dying all alone.
So lift me up or let me go.
'Cause this body doesn't feel like home.

No!
This body doesn't feel like home.
No!

Love feels far away.
The lack of motivation keeps the soul from bettering, it's no life.
Now reach the next level with a bottle and a blade.
Retreating it is no way.

Suffocation and the fear of living setting in, so let go.
Let go before he lets go.
Patience is wearing thin and leaving him, so let go.
Let go before he lets go of this life.

I wonder what goes on behind those bloodshot eyes?
I wonder what goes on?
Before he lets go he says.

Send an angel to pull me from the hell below.
This weight is far too much to hold.
And this body doesn't feel like home.
Send an angel, I feel I'm dying all alone.
So lift me up or let me go.
'Cause this body doesn't feel like home.

Sleep now and carry on into the black of the night.
Sleep now and you'll be on your way.
There's another one moving on from the flatline, flatline.

Sleep now and carry on into the black of the night.
Sleep now and you'll be on your way.
There's another one moving on from the flatline, flatline.

Slip into the fray.
Slip between the night and day.

Sleep now and carry on into the black of the night.
Head greaves with everything but does it make it right?
There's another one moving on from the flatline, flatline.

Sleep now and carry on, it doesn't matter.
Head greaves with everything but does it make it right?
There's another one moving on from the flatline, flatline.
