I took my shirt off in the yard
No one saw that the skin on my shoulders was golden
Now it's not
My shirt's back on
I forgot my songs
The glow is gone
My gliding body stopped

I could not get through September without a battle
I faced death
I went in with my arms swinging
But I heard my own breath
And I had to face that I'm still living
I'm still flesh
I hold on to awful feelings

I'm not dead
There's no end
My face is red
My blood flows harshly

My heart beats loudly

My chest still draws breath
I hold it
I'm buoyant
Ooh oh oh
There's no end
