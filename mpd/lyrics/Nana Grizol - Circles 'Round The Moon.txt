Circles 'round the moon,
Is this why city lights feel so awful?
It should be unlawful
To live where you can't see the stars

Hundreds of miles away we draw the
Same lines to conclusions
There's no need for confusion
If we all throw in the towel

But down the street from here
There's a forest and a lake
I go there when my brain's too full
To try to break down and un-complicate
To interpret the things
We said in letters and phone calls
Not enough for us to tell,
How was your day?

Circles 'round the block,
Is this how all my time gets wasted?
I don't think so,
But we tasted the night air
And now we just want more

A thousand postcards later,
We seem older but that's normal
Our car's broke down
And its just too cold
To hitchhike to your door

But, down the street from here there's a forest and a lake
I go there when my brain's too full to try to break down and un-complicate
To interpret the things we said
In letters and phone calls

Not enough for us to tell,
How was your day?
Not enough for us to tell,
How was your day?
