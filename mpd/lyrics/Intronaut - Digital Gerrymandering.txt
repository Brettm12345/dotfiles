We restart, refresh, and then we shut down
Give up and find something better to do
Why do we care?
What do we need?
Try as we might we simply are not entertained
We sit and stare
Contempt for it all
We take umbrage
At the transience of our machine
Show us how to live
Show us who we are
Our connection is lost
We will never be the change we used to want to see
Our connection is lost
We will never cross the lines that were drawn for us
Our connection is lost
Let's try pulling the plug...
