"It's 10 minutes past curfew. Why are you still up?"

News broadcast:
"In other news bizarre rumours of political and religious 
leaders that have shocked this city over the last month seems to have ended as 
suddenly as they began.  No terrorist group has come forth claiming 
responsibility for the slaying, but police have a suspect in custody under 
observation at state hospital.  His identity is being withheld pending further 
investigation.  Sports and weather next."

Nurse:
"Hello? Hellooo? 
"Perhaps you need another shot."
(nurse injects, some grunting)
"There that should do it."
(nurse walks to door, opens it)
"Sweet dreams. You bastard."
(nurse closes door)

Nikki:
I remember now
I remember how it started
I can't remember yesterday
I just remember doing what they told me
Told me…
Told me…
Told me…
