I live in a castle, I am a prince
On days I try to please my queen

Soon as I start to smile, my smiling queen
Who sits across the table by the food she made

Like a bat, I flushed the girl
And I flew out my back door
And I came to no one no more
She ran without glances
And railed like a red coal train
She ran without glances
And railed like a red coal train

Eyelids are open when the sun is high 
I slip away from my queen's gray stare
I can be settled down and be doing just fine
Until I hear that old train rolling down the line

With the light she disappeared
And set me in a whirl
And I hope that beautiful girl
I set a fire burning
And I railed on through the night
I set a fire burning
And I railed on through the night

She peeked around the corner
She offered me her hand
My teeth touched her skin
Then she was gone again

Now my queen is fine in her early grave
After that girl, I'll keep her warm
There's nothing more to save
