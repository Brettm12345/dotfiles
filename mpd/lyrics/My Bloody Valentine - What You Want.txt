What I do I say
But I can't get far away
Oh, I go back to
A memory again
What you want?
Don't you know that I'm alive?
Then I go back to you
Don't you know what I feel inside?

When you come down blue
But I do, I do, I do
Oh, I come back to
The one who calls my name out
What you want?
Don't you know that I can smile?
Then I go back to you
And then you're wakened up inside

Turn it up and smile
Though I can't see through your eye
Could I fall into, who only comes through mine?
Come back down, no I can't believe my lie
Hey, ask around you
Don't you know that I've asked why?

When you come down blue
But I do, I do, I do
Oh, I come back to
The one who calls my name out
What you want?
Don't you know that I'm alive?
Then I go back to you
And then you're wakened up inside
