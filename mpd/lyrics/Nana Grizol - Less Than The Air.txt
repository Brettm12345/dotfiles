Train's coming, gonna lay on the track
Happy right here laying on my back
Let the train wheel come and take my life
Yeah, let the big steel make it all right
Because I've got no friends to tell the trial
Lots of enemies so quick to defile
Suppose I'm drunk again but I don't care
All I know is we're less than the air
So let's not compare

Feelings sacrificed you, are you feeling slammed
And are you claustrophobic on this open land
Feeling crumpled up and dented in
Are you trapped within your very own skin

Well, it's like a jail you can't see the bars
Can't escape it by bleeding through your scars
Self deprecation is a boring hand
And your just bringing everybody down man

Feeling sorry, are you feeling blue
Are you down and out now and overdue
Feeling smothered by the deep blue sky
Does the sunset hurt your eye
Oh well, you're not the only one who got caught in the rain
This whole world don't revolve around your pain
And you can go on, yeah, spin out in misery
But I'll take the sun and the sea

And oh sham sham-a-ling-on
And oh dipty dip
My mental record starts to skip

An orange, lemon, lime, and oh, a tangelo
On the coconut tree next to the mighty mango
Oh the high sea air, yeah, in my rear view mirror
Ain't it beauty, beautiful my lovely dear
We got time so, so let's not abuse
Let's wear holes in our shoes
