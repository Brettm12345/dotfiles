Undo the blood you’re tied to
That noose seeks a truce
Horror sleeps without you
Wake up in a tomb

Now is all you feel
Why you're so anxious
The precious decline to see this out
Now is all your feel
Now tearing yourself apart
Just one more thing

Solitude, it's so static
Your white lies and black magic
Solitude, it's so static
Your white lies and black magic

But if this ends your life be grateful
If this ends your life be grateful
If this ends your life be grateful
If this ends your life be grateful

Just put yourself aside
Reconstruct your faith in another life
Reconstruct your past
Put yourself aside
Reconstruct life’s war

Now is all you feel
Why you're so anxious
The precious decline to see this out
Now is all you feel
Now tearing yourself apart
Just one more thing

Fade away along the way
Crawl away alone

Solitude, it's so static
Your white lies and black magic
Solitude, it's so static
