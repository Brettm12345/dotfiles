If you wanna make the move
Then you better come in
It's just the ability to reason
That wears so thin
Living and dying and the stories that are true
Secrets to a good life is knowing when you're through

[Chorus]
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah, the boy's a time bomb
[x2]

Well, he's back in the hole where they got him living
Like a rat but he's smarter than that nine lives
Like a cat 15 years old take him to the youth authority home
First thing you learn is that you got to make it
In this world alone

[Chorus]

Now he's gotten out he's gotten free he's gotta go gotta car
21 years old he's runnin' numbers from the bar
His pager's beepin' he's got in deep in
Whatever he can move on in you know that kid's a creepin'

[Chorus]
The boyâ€™s a time bomb

Tears come from the razor that's been tattooed below
His eye his mother cries she knows that he is strong enough
To die he's rollin' in the Cadillac it's midnight sunroof is down
Three shots rung out, the hero's dead, the new king is crowned.

[Chorus x2]
Ohh, time bomb
