Pushing forward, highway miles are cheaper than in town
If you left something behind we'll try your best not to let it get you down
The city's full of bullshit, I don't sleep there anymore
I don't want it's schmoozy eagerness, I don't want to be it's whore

But we, we are so awestruck by the way that things just are
Like the way the sun shines till it's night time
We fall asleep to the sound of passing cars

It's that sinking sunken feeling
That you get on the roofs of tall buildings
Staring out over the bay or broken cityscapes that make you cry
And it's not sad you just don't know how to begin to ask why

Just a few more cigarettes and I'll come back inside
And do you ever get the feeling
Something somewhere in you is still alive
And saying "Oh and it's a big life, as big as it can be
And if you cannot see the beauty well don't give up so easily
And it's a weak-kneed conversation telling your new revelation
To a choir of a more cynical nature

"Being your ego and your I'd
The part that swears to you you'll never want kids
The part that drinks away each night
And in the morning wakes at ten and goes to work

So let's not be so bitter at least not just yet
I keep meaning to say everything's ok
Well how presumptuous is that?

And sure we all get hurt sometimes
And sure we all feel ashamed
But if our friends can't help us through these things
I don't know what friendship means
And I don't know just what it is I'm trying to say
