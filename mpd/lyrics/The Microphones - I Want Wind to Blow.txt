The thunder clouds broke up
And the rain dried up, the lightning let up
The clacking shutters just shut up

There's no black or white, no change in the light
No night, no golden sun

The sound of cars, the smell of bars
The awful feeling of electric heat
And the fluorescent lights, there's sacrifice
There's hard feelings, there's pointless waste

I want wind
To blow

My clothes off me sweep me off my feet
Take me up and bring me back
Oh, where I can see, days pass by me
I have no head to hold in grief

But there's no hope for me, I've been set free
There's no breeze, there's no ship on my sea
