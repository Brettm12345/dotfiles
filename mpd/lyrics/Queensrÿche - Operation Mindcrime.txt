Nikki:
"Hello?"

Dr. X:
"Mindcrime"

It just takes a minute
And you'll feel no pain
Gotta make something of your life boy
Give me one more vein

You've come to see the doctor
'Cause I'll show you the cure
I'm gonna take away the questions, yeah
I'm gonna make you sure, yeah

A hitman for the order
When you couldn't go to school
Had a skin job for a hair-do
Yeah, you looked pretty cool

Had a habit doing mainline
Watch the dragon burn
No regrets, you got no goals
Nothing more to learn

Now I know you won't refuse
Because we've got so much to do
And you've got nothing more to lose
So take this number and welcome to

Operation: Mindcrime
We're an underground revolution working overtime
Operation: Mindcrime
There's a job for you in the system, boy
With nothing to sign

Hey Nikki, you know everything that there is to do
Here's a gun take it home, wait by the phone
We'll send someone over to bring you what you need
You're a one man death machine
Make this city bleed

Now I know you won't refuse (I know you won't refuse)
Because we've got so much to do (we've got so much to do)
And you've got nothing more to lose
So take this number and welcome to

Operation: Mindcrime
We're an underground revolution working overtime
Operation: Mindcrime
There's a job for you in the system, boy
With nothing to sign

Operation: Mindcrime

With nothing to sign
