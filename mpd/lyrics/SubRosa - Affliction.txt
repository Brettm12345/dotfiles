Oh, sweet God above, please take me home
Show me the mercy that he denied
I've paid my dues, and I've served my time
The shadow's haunting me the way it haunted him
He looked in my baby's eyes and he felt nothing then
He felt nothing then, and he feels nothing now
Not a day goes by that I don't think of him
I don't know what he suffered Lord, I don't know what he's seen
But he's spread his sadness like a disease
The shadow's haunting me the way it haunted him
He looked in my baby's eyes and he felt nothing then
He felt nothing then, and all I feel's anguish now
There's is a darkness born out of time
It creeps along the edge of our excess
Its hatred ripples in our fertile hearts
Like heat waves shimmering with their mirage
It gathers chessmen and loaded guns
It snuffs candles out one by one
Oh, sweet God above, please take me home
Show me the mercy that he denied
