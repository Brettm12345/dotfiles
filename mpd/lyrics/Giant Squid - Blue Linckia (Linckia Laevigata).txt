If you were to sever my arm I would grow one more
As I regenerate I'll still have another four
It would not be the first time autotomy has saved me
If you were to sever my legs I would grow two more
As I regenerate I'll still crawl on the floor
These pieces please feel free to keep all for yourself
They'll eat and breathe and grow into unsightly things
Haunting you with their resemblance of me
Though lacking any sort of heart I figure they'll fare better in your company
They're all yours now
Please keep them well fed because they're all yours now
