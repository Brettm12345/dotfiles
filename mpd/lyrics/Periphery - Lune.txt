Snow coming down now
Like December, burning up in the summer rays
But I'm not stumbling, like a pretender
Medicine flowing through my veins

Heavy eyes like a tongue won't stutter
Mouths are moving, and this heart's still fluttering
I'm on my own!

You found me at the core now
I am wrapped within the warmth of your touch
There's never a moment that I let slip by in your eyes
Are we growing old day and day?
Am I melting in the rays of this love?
Never ever gonna let you go
Don't let go

Never gonna let you go

Slow it down, now
I cannot remember why I let them chew on my brain
They've and left this town
In smoldering embers,
But my gift will dye in your eye

Heavy eyes like a tongue won't stutter
Mouths are moving, and this heart's still fluttering
I'm on my own!

You found me at the core now
I am wrapped within the warmth of your touch
There's never a moment that I let slip by in your eyes
Are we growing old day and day?
Am I melting in the rays of this love?
Never ever gonna let you go
Don't let go!

Do you feel the love?
Yes I feel the love
Chase it, hold it, feel it, never let it go
Do you feel the love?
Yes I feel the love
Do you feel the love?
Yes I feel the love
Chase it, hold it, feel it, never let it go!
Never let it go!
Don't let go!
Don't let go!
