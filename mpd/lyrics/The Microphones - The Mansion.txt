There's no end, there's no glory
There's a slow resounding story
There's no place to feel certain
There's no body waiting for me

There's no stand of trees, no morning
There's a curve without a warning
There is weird and lasting sadness
There's no large and lengthy warming

There's no heat, there's no expansion
There's no door into the mansion
Lengthy warming, sweet removal
Sweet expanse, sweet and substantial

There's no flesh
There's no fingers in my hair
I see a tunnel

We built walls, tall and solid
Between the treasure and the shovel

I see an inn, I see a fountain
There's a trail over the mountain
There's no wayside, there's no stopping
And the peak is wide and rocky

There's no ceiling in the mansion
There's no waste no hesitation
There's no crack of dawn, no morning
Just an everlasting warming
