Open your eyes and exalt--Exalt! in this fragile world, in this knowing flesh, in this very moment
We have forsaken the delusions of Comprehension as we are born into the certainty of the Sensual
We are the stone that starts the avalanche
We are the cough that spreads the plague
We are the spark that lights the inferno
Relinquish those wretched controls of knowledge and experience, those conditions which hinder Desire's progress
Cut away esoteric corruption and seek unfettered fulfillment
In defiance of the sages
In defiance of the intelligentsia
Useless philosophy, theory, and poetry must be heaped upon the cairn
See them consumed in Action--sweet, reckless Action
Join our sad tears and dance on the blackened bones of gods
Beyond the shadow of the citadel, there is no such thing as time, there is no such thing as negation
There is only this tangible, perceptible world
There is only this moment, this very moment
