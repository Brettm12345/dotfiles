Midnight wish, blow me a kiss, blowing one to you
Act like this, try to pretend it's true
Show me all your favorite things, show you all mine too
Wake and wish, I'll give them up to you

Hold on to your promises, hold on to mine too
Caught like this, I'll turn it in with you
Fall apart, my bleeding heart, nothing left to do
Once in love, I'll be the death of you
