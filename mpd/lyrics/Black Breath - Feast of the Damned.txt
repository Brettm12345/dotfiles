Come to me my children
As a jackal to the lamb
Taste the blood of heaven
As it drips down your skin
Eat your fill my children
Feed the hunger that demands
My flesh cannot go to waste
Consume the son of man

Feast of the damned
Devouring the body
Drink the blood
From the hands

Desecrate my body
The ritual demands
Lap the wounds of my flesh
For a dog cannot sin
Use your teeth and your claws
Strip clean flesh from bone
All things are defiled
So are these sacred words

Feast of the damned
Devouring the body
Drink the blood
From the hands

My flesh...
My blood...
Your skin...
Feast of the damned
