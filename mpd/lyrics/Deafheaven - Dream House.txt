Hindered by sober restlessness
Submitting to the amber crutch

The theme in my aching prose
The theme in my aching prose

Fantasizing the sight of Manhattan
Fantasizing the sight of Manhattan

That pour of a bitter red being that escapes a thin frame
That pour of a bitter red

The rebirth of mutual love
The rebirth of mutual love
The slipping on gloves to lay
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly
The slipping on gloves to lay
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly
Slipping on the gloves

Slipping on gloves, gloves
Gloves
Slipping on gloves

I'm dying
Is it blissful?
It's like a dream
I want to dream

I'm dying
Is it blissful?
It's like a dream
I want to dream
I want to dream

I want to dream

I want to dream
