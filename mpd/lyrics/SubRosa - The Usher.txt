All of my life, I've been waiting for you
Come lay down your head, rest in my arms, you're free tonight
You're in the yes of those whose luck has run out
A tender end to a life of descent

Every lawman knows that you cannot be argued
Even despots know that when they die, you'll rule still

You're supreme, immutable, unchanging
You're never failing through the ages
You are the usher at the unknown portal
You stand silent among the din and clamor

All of my life I've been waiting for you
With open arms, I'll come running towards you

You're supreme, immutable, unchanging
You're never failing through the ages
You're more constant than the stars
Because the change their paths with the seasons

You're more constant than the Moon
Because she hides her face in the shadows
You're more constant than the sun
Because one day her embrace will melt the earth
You're more constant than the gods
Because sometimes when we call, they don't answer at all

All in all, we end the same
(Come lay down your head, rest in my arms, you're free tonight)
