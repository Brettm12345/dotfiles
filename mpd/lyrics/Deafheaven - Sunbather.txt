I held my breath and drove through a maze of wealthy homes
I watched how green the trees were
I watched how green the trees were

I watched the steep walkways and the white fences
I gripped the wheel
I gripped the wheel

I gripped the wheel
I gripped the wheel

I sweated against the leather
I sweated against the leather

I watched the dogs twist through the wealthy garden
I watched the dogs twist through the wealthy garden
Through the wealthy garden

I watched you lay on a towel in grass that exceeded the height of your legs
I gazed into reflective eyes
I cried against an ocean of light

An ocean of light
An ocean of light

Crippled by the cushion, I sank into sheets

Frozen by rose petal toes
Rose petal toes
My back shivered
For your pressed granite nails

Dishonest and ugly through the space in my teeth
Break bones down to yellow and crush gums into blood

The hardest part
For the weak
Was stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth

The hardest part
For the weak
Was stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth
Stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth

It's 5 AM
And my heart flourishes at each passing moment
Always and forever, always and forever

It's 5 AM
And my heart flourishes at each passing moment
Always and forever, always and forever

Always and forever
Always and forever
