[Chorus:]
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb

[Verse 1:]
The sun may never rise again
The question ain’t if but when
The sea will boil and the sky will fall
The sun may never rise again

The silent war has begun
We’re staring down a loaded gun
No refuge found on solid ground
This human race can’t be won

[Pre-Chorus:]
Don’t wait to say goodbye
You’re running out of time
Whatever you believe
It’s easy to see

[Chorus:]
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb

And it’s about to explode

(The whole world) [x4]

[Verse 2:]
The future is a dying art
Laying in a ditch in the dark
I need you here but all I hear (is)
The beating of a broken heart

[Pre-Chorus:]
Don’t wait to say goodbye
You’re running out of time
Whatever you believe
It’s easy to see

[Chorus:]
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb

And it’s about to explode [x2]
(The whole world) [repeats on background]
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb [x2]
And it don’t care what side you’re on
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep your calm and carry on
The whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
