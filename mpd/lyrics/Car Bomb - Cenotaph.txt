Stop the flood of praise
No one forgives

In the mouth your eyes
Reverse the spin

Cenotaph egg shells

Stop the flood of pain
Climbing through the sand and crowding stares

Soft words splash beneath whispered wings of your mind

Cry into your arm sleeve
Open up
Run into this grave
Kill the light seeping inward through sensitive eyes

All empty graves nothing there to save
Wide umbrellas cover cloudless comforts

Soft words splash beneath whispered wings of your mind wants yourself to heal
Stuck sounds sway above screaming wings
Out of your mind
All it wants is to cut

Cut it all cut it all down beside the lake
Bet it all on the shovel in your garden
Make sure you bury deep
Hide the sun

Lay your head down the ground the cemetery
Cut it all cut it all down
