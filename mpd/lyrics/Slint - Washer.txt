Good night my love
Remember me as you fall to sleep
Fill your pockets with the dust and the memories
That rises from the shoes on my feet
I won't be back here though we may meet again

I know it's dark outside
Don't be afraid
Every time I ever cried from fear was just a mistake that I made
Wash yourself in your tears and build your church
On the strength of your faith

Please, listen to me
Don't let go
Don't let this desperate moonlight leave me
With your empty pillow
Promise me the sun will rise again

I too am tired now
Embracing thoughts of tonight's dreamless sleep
My head is empty
My toes are warm
I am safe from harm
