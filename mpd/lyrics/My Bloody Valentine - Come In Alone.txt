Come in alone
Do you love to let go?
And I'll turn you around
When you're holding me down
Ooh, why hide?

Why, I don't need
To believe what you see
To look up and around
You will come, won't come out
To a sound

Feel, I'm alive
You will see, one wouldn't mind
So don't cry, overall
I will go to them all
Love, for some

Come in alone
Do you love to let go?
And I'll turn you around
When you're holding me down
Love, why hide?
