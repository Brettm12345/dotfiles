She's a model and she's looking good
I'd like to take her home with me, that's understood
Playing hard-to-get, she smiles from time to time
It only takes a camera to change her mind

Posing for consumer products now and then
I even saw her on the cover of a magazine
She's going out to nightclubs drinking just champagne
She is looking good, I want to see her again
