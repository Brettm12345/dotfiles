I got hit hard, I'm on the ground
And if you swing again I'll duck
And I wish you best of luck
You deserve yourself
And I return from my trip to hell
As a headless horseman

Oh what I lost
I went back to get my stuff
And it was tangled up and tough
I stood there and stared you down
And I walked aimlessly around
With a flaming pumpkin head
Oh what a loss
My soft hands replaced by claws
You turned me into a stray dog, from mighty human man
Oh what a loss
Oh what a loss
I miss my closest friend
And now I cling to rocks and wind
It's a precious thing we lost
