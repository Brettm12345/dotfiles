Flash through this life like a death grip, we're satisfied
It's the mundane I'm keeping out of sight but still
We are young, we are young, I'll steer the angels down
Keep 'em in the back room, shut the door, let go

And now he's there at the grey, gold dead bed of lies
Pushing daisies while we still feel the sunshine
We are young, we are young, sift through the marigolds
To please our damaged souls

This place is holding me
Jump through the rope, let's make it credible
When blood is all we see
Life is impossible

Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling
We're on the clock and the needle's turning
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spark to work it out

You're just another one wandering
Endlessly on to the grave

The signs of the times are upon us
So we're grieving for tomorrow
Sucking on the mother's dead tit
I'm so low, so low

It's all right, we learn it all before we go
Snapped by the neck as we swallow
Chin up, I'm tying the rope
Leaving all hollow

This place is holding me
Jump through the rope, let's make it credible
When blood is all we see
Life is impossible

Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling
We're on the clock and the needle's turning fast
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spark to work it out

No funeral, no pyre that's burning
This body's dust in the wind that's hurling past
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spark to work it out

I guess I will just leave things the way they are

This place is holding me (This place is holding me)
Jump through the rope, let's make it credible (Credible)
When blood is all we see
Life is impossible

Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling
We're on the clock and the needle's turning
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spark to work it out

Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling
We're on the clock and the needle's turning fast
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spark to work it out

No funeral, no pyre that's burning
This body's dust in the wind that's hurling past
The misery's killing me slowly
Give me a spark to work it out
