The man with the eyes that are dead
And the woman who knew what was next
He speaks to the world, as he pays for his sins with a golden doubloon
Blink once for "I'm guilty"
Blink twice for "We know"
The pieces fit together
Like so many arms and legs
The lifeless, limbless body returns
And all we can do is search for a head to scratch
