And now, the car bomb

Yo, re-re, come on man, let's get the fuck up out of here, man
All right baby, all right speedy, I'm coming, damn
Took a motherfuckin' hour to get dressed

I wanna be in and out, now, don't fuck around over here
And baby, I'm lookin' good, all right, I'm lookin' good

I'm sayin', fuck that man, I'm tryin' to get the fuck up out of here, man
All right, all right, I'm comin' damn shit
Yo, yo, yo, hold it, hold it, whassup, this shit?
You know the people right there?
You know those motherfuckers right there?
No nigga, I don't know, you paranoid

What the fuck they lookin' at? I'm sayin' you ain't seen
The motherfuckers ridin' past lookin' all at me and shit
Nigga, you trippin', now you trippin', nigga you trippin'
Let's go, scary-ass nigga you hidin' somethin', let's keep
Man, fuck that man, get in the car, man aw, goddamn
Told you don't fuck around over here and shit, whatever

Damn, what the fuckin' up with this shit?
You didn't put no gas in this raggedy motherfucker, goddamn!

Ain't this a bitch, pined-out Pete let's keep, oh my goodness
Man, shut the fuck up, let me start my motherfuckin' shit
Fuck you, nigga, take me
