I saw you standing there and well I, well I
I can't be trusted
I'm lost without a reason
But I think I could love you if only you would stop staring at me
When the sentences I make don't turn out right
I cannot handle it
No. Don't take it as an insult
I only wish you were staring at me
When I roll over because I can't sleep at night
Or when I'm smiling because there's snow falling outside
Or when the brakes lock and we're clearly gonna die
I'm gonna grab your arm and scream, "I love you!"
I hope you know that I'll love you
