Rip my heart to pieces – tear my soul down to the ground – for I am no more
Rip my lifes to pieces – see the circle’s now done – I float – and I’m gone!!!

Screamed so long for peace inside – feel the pain rise every night – and now as I in darkness dwell – I wish I’d never be born!!!

Blessing all these scars inside – I walk those blood fields at night – I hate with love from deep inside – and turn the key to never be born

Screamed so long for peace inside – feel the pain rise every night – and now as I in darkness dwell – I’d wish I’d be never reborn!!!

Screamed... for peace inside – Pain... rise every night – Paths... those bloody nights – Hate... from deep inside
