Full speed to a future of self-medication and poor understanding
Of everything you wasted four years in learning
The future, the future, the air's fucking burning!
And sleep, I can't sleep. I did some funny things with my best friend Patrick
This is a song that will most likely bore you
This is a song that will most likely put you to sleep
Oh my
My god

Why do I stay up late just to wake up late and feel lousy?
If that's the thing, if that's everything, why can't I stop?
Another empty hearted notion gone to shit, but it belongs in shit

Why can't I see the sunspots in your eyes?
Why can't I see the sunspots in your eyes?
Why can't I see the sunspots in your eyes?
Why can't I see the sunspots in your eyes?
Why!
