"Let me in."
The voice cried softly, from outside the wooden door
Scattered remnants of the ship could be seen in the distance
Blood stained the icy wall of the shore

"I'm the only one left, the storm took them all."
He managed, as he tried to stand
The tears ran down his face
"Please, it's cold."

When he woke, there was no trace of the ship
Only the dawn was left behind by the storm
He felt the creaking of the stairs beneath him
That rose from the sea, to the door

There was a sound at the window then
The captain started, his breath was still
Slowly, he turned

From behind the edge of the windowsill
There appeared a delicate hand of a child
His face was flushed and timid
He stared at the captain through frightened eyes

The captain reached for something to hold on to
"Help me", he whispered, as he rose slowly to his feet
The boy's face went pale
He recognized the sound
Silently, he pulled down the shade against the shadow
Lost in the doorstep of the empty house

"I'm trying to find my way home
I'm sorry, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I've grown taller now
I want the police to be notified
And I swear by this song
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you
I miss you!
I miss you!
Ooh-ah, miss you!
I miss you!!"
