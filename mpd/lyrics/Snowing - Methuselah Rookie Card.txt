Hey.
I'm dazed on your front lawn tonight.
I'll drive home screaming at the Drive-In.
And I've been driving
This thing for too long,
And on and on and the point is etc.
And I will explode if I don't.
Believe me, that I know.
And I will explode if I don't kiss you now.
I've been living like a sailor,
My sea legs are wearing down.
I've been living like a sailor,
My sea legs are wearing down.
