Aurora swims in the ether,
Emerald fire scars the night sky.

Sólstafir!

Amber streams from Sol
Are not unlike the waves
Of the sea, nor the endless horizon of ice.

Sólstafir!

Aurora swims in the ether,
Emerald fire paints the twilight.

Heidrun bleeds the golden nectar
For the rising sun and the moon.
The midnight wolves who watch over the dawn,
The golden dawn.

Sólstafir!
