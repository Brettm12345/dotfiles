Disable consequence, both sides
Enable convergence inside
Triangles pointing to the top
Rectangles four corners then stop

Closing all the shapes you see
Riding them eternally
Calculate the cost

Floating on an endless string
Tied behind the angel's wings
Calculate

Sum up the edge of this nonsense

Wait
Don't stop the aftermath
First target all those who forget
Procrastinate
Time will go slow

Wait but donâ€™t stop the aftermath
Next target all those who pretend
Instantiate the next vision
The rectangles
Isolation to form the edge

Wait
Stop the aftermath
Next target all those who divide
Degenerate the vertex

Pierce through the aftermath
Then target all those who deflect
Illuminate

Parallel planes
Aggregate dimensions to the vertex of the prism
