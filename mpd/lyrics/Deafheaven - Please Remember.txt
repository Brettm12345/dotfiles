Twisting and turning beside the slumbering Tereza, he recalled something she had told him a long time before in the course of an insignificant conversation
They had been talking about his friend Z, when she announced, "If I hadn't met you, I'd certainly have fallen in love with him"
Even then, her words had left Tomas in a strange state of melancholy, and now he realized it was only a matter of chance that Tereza loved him and not his friend Z
Apart from her consummated love for Tomas, there were, in the realm of possibility, an infinite number of unconsummated loves for other men
We all reject out of hand the idea that the love of our life may be something light or weightless
We presume our love is what must be, that without it our life would no longer be the same
We feel Beethoven himself, gloomy and awe-inspiring, is playing to our own great love
