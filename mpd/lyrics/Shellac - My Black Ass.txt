Gonna eat what I pick
And I hope you choke on it
I'm proud to break a sweat

Too late
For Satchel Paige
It's a Gary Cooper story
And it shines like Sammy's knee

Gonna eat what I pick
And I hope you choke on it
When I dance I raise the dead

Drop a nickel in my hat
Take one look at your big smile

Proud to break a sweat

My black ass
