The found gold here but they never found me
Underneath the temple on main street
Where men spent their dust and one took my life
In a town where two rivers collide
I'm still here
After the fire but before the water
They made sure to leave no one on the bottom
All the graves were lifted to higher ground
But where I lay they never found
I'm still here
