Ought to know what I liar I am
Ought to know me by now
Don't curse me for my nature
Don't blast me for my wrongs
Just a bad penny
I always come back to you
Just a bad penny

Just a bad penny
I always come back to you
Should have known you couldn't trust me
As far as you could throw me, throw me
You couldn't throw me to far
Just a bad penny
Couldn't throw me to far

I think I fucked your girlfriend once
Maybe twice, I don't remember
Then I fucked all your friend's girlfriends
Now they hate you

Just a bad penny
Just a bad penny
Such a bad penny
A bad bad penny

Ought to know what I liar I am
Ought to know me by now
Such a bad penny
A bad bad penny
Ought to know what I liar I am
Ought to know me by now
Ought to know you couldn't trust me
As far as you could throw me, throw me
Such a bad penny
Such a bad penny
Slap my hand
