It is to see
A traitor go free
It is to feel
A filter in me

It is to leave
The lights that I saw
It is to ask
Is it easy to go

In this dead hour
Here with you seconds are worthless
In this dead hour
When all is blank
Minutes are worthless

How long will
It take until
There will be room
Again for hope

It is so sad to see
Dispossession
It has become
My obsession now

It is to have
A knife in my back
It is to say
My soul got a crack

In this dead hour
Here with you seconds are worthless
In this dead hour
When all is blank
Minutes are worthless

-Solo-

In this dead hour
Here with you seconds are worthless
In this dead hour
When all is blank
Minutes are worthless
