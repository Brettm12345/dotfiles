Voices echo down the halls
And we're leaning against walls
How long do you suppose till this one falls?

We could just stand right here with a smile
That'll only entertain us for a short while
And were you seriously waiting for this call?

Remember when I said I had to get away?
I was just looking for something to say
Hope that explains why I could not stay

And I remember when you said you had to get away
Well I sure hope that you do someday
That is if it gets boring here anyway

And why is everything like that some kind of creep
When that's the same stuff under your feet
That connects where your standing to a place you'd rather be

I left home being quite discrete
That I could use someone in the passenger seat
But none would I expect to follow me

Party all night, nervous tic
Try out new accents maybe one will stick
Crack knuckles and put yourself to bed

Sleep through the morning, deafly turn off alarms
Hey, it's the summer Hey, it's no harm
And why wait to get enough sleep till your dead

Eleven hour drive Midwest again
Same mixtape nine times, maybe ten
Entertaining thoughts that's like a legacy
May never end, oh

Until the new one does begin
And will you break or will you bend
I hope you make a few new friends
