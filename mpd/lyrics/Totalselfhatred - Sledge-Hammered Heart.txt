No more dreams to fulfill
In this life that holds still
I have lost the light in my life
Why can't I see it was all a dream?
Have I lived in a lie that I made myself?

All the lies behind my smiles
They say that true love never dies... but you will...
All that we shared feels like a lie
I wish that I could turn back time
To the point when it all was fine

Let me be a part of this dream, all that we used to be
I am all alone when it all falls apart, no one to catch when I fall
All the dreams have faded away in a world where love has ceased to exist
Take my heart and let me die, just take my heart but let me die
