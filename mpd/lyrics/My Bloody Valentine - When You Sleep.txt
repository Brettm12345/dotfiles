When I look at you
Oh, but I don't know what's real
Won't stand a while
And you make me laugh

And I'll sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Won't stand around
Then you take me down
When you walk away

When you say "I do"
Oh, but I don't believe you
I can't forget it
Ooh

When you sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Won't stand a while
When you make me smile
And you turn and walk us down

When I look at you
Oh, but I don't know what's real
Won't stand a while
And you make me laugh

And I'll sleep tomorrow
And it won't be long
Won't stand around
Then you take me down
When you walk away
