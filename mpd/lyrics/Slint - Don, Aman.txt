Don stepped outside

It felt good to be alone
He wished he was drunk
He thought about something he just said
And how stupid it had sounded

He knew he should forget about it
He decided to piss but he couldn't
A plane passed silently overhead
The streetlight, and the buds on the trees, and the night were still

It finally came
He took a deep breath
It made him feel strong
And determined
To go back inside

The light
Their backs
Their conversation, the couples, romancing so natural

His friends stare
With eyes like the heads of nails

The others
Glances
With amusement, with evasion
With contempt so distant
With malice for being a stye
In their engagement

Like swimming underwater in the darkness
Like walking through an empty house
Speaking to an imaginary audience
Being watched from outside
By a (soul without a key)
He could not dance to anything

Don left and drove
And howled and laughed at himself
He felt he knew what that was

Don woke up
And looked at the night before
He knew what he had to do
He was responsible
In the mirror, he saw his friend
