Not to say were not fortunate to be born
To a world that encourages us to grow
But sometimes perpetual motion moves so slow

Hunger for a change of scenery
You drive North in search of snow
Were you prepared for certain shadows
To follow you everywhere that you go

Your body's been decaying all this time
And now it finally starts to show
And are you having second thoughts
About that path that you chose

Now that the fire in your eyes
Has burned down like coals
To a warm consistent glow
Well hey that smoke has cleared
You regained the use of your nose

So take take a second now
To stop and smell the roses
Just like you never thought you had time
But always thought that you should
At least for now it okay to take life in smaller doses
Something new has come to town
Seems like he's doing you good

And I've come to a new town
Yeah sure it's somewhat the same
It feels good to be aware of
But still not focused on the cause behind that pain

And sometimes when the mood is right it feels
Like every inch and nothings changed
But in some way that not for one second
Has stayed the same

So you remember to eat dinner
Remember to feel better
Remember your friends
They'll think that you forgot them
If you only write secret letters
Remember not to focus on
Those feelings that you lack
You just might give yourself a heart attack
