I know you don't think that I think of the things that you say for, 
I turn around and say "buddy it's okay"
And I know you don't think I could understand
Why there's a lifetime of pain behind bright shining eyes.

Maybe I won't but dear friend you know I will try.

I know you think that you are half as good
As the people who do just the things that the should.

We follow our own paths gotta do some trailblazing
A minute of movement for a year of stargazing

But you find that you've come out with a billion horns blazing, 
It's amazing just to know you're alive.

I know you don't think that I'm leaving over you
And I know that you know I'm not staying for that too.
I know that's not what you wanted me to do.
What do I want? I wish that I knew.

I can't see the future, I don't know the end, 
I can always predict that we'll always be friends.
We'll grow, we'll change, and we'll see you again, 
Like two seeds grown apart to different
In different places in the front yard.
We'll grow toward the sun, those sometimes it will be hard, 
We'll grow up the fence, and our stems intertwine
We'll share stories of other branches stretched out behind and ahead.
Green with life, flowers of brilliant red.
And we'll laugh at the thought, that you could know you've got, 
And the idea that everything could possibly ever be said.
