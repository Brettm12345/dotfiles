I've been wasting this fucking year on
The idea of getting up and moving on
But I wait around, just emptying bottles
In the basement of the slovak center on my side of town

It's a major fucking bummer

Because I feel nothing like my father
He's been sleeping underground
Don't wait around. There's nothing there at all
There's nothing but the end

You're not awake
(Tell me, tell me the things that I'll never have)
So I'll just stay home
(I'm talking to you)
You're not awake
(Tell me, tell me the things that I'll never have)

You're fucking gone
