Our ship struck twice by a whale
Now dig in a bail before it's too late
With the brine up to our knees
All I can think is how you'll be the first to be eaten
You will
With the shit this deep you have to leave all the things behind that you can't eat
Far too many adrift at sea
You are our chosen source of meat
With the brine up to our knees
All I can think is how you'll be the first to be eaten
You will
