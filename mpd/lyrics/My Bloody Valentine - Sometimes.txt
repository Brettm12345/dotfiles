Close my eye, feel me, how?
I don't know, but you could not love me now
You were low, and I feel down to the ground
Over there, and I want you love to know
You can't hide, oh no, oh the way I do

Turn my head into sound
I don't know, when I lay down on the ground
You will find, when you're head down, hurts to love
Never cared, and you're halting, hurts to love
You will see, oh down, on the way I do

You will wait, see me go
I don't care when you're head turned all along
You will wait, when I turn my eyes around
Overhead, then I hold you next to me
Overhead, too, now, oh the way I see

Close my eye, feel me, how?
I don't know, but you could not love me now
You were low, and I feel down too
Over there, and I wait, true love, for you
You can't hide, oh no, oh the way I do
You will see, oh down, on the way I do
