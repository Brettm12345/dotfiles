You drove home for the first time in 3 weeks today
Where is home? I'm not so sure that I'm so sure these days
Well I'm sure to come and visit you someday
There's no telephone that does justice to all the things I have to say
And all the songs that we could play together when we're face to face
A billion years could surely not erase
The smell of your deodorant and how it blends with sweat
Or a tiny car delivering our darling quartet
To a distant destination with all it's life
Yeah, I danced under the milky way last night
