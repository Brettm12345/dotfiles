I left your lover in the slough
I left your lover in the slough
He spilled his guts but none of it was true
I left your lover in the slough.

All the letters he wrote you
Were left in plain view
I recited them out loud as I was running him through
I left your lover in the slough.

Crayfish will do as they wish
No need to stick around and watch
Crayfish will do as they wish with every inch of him.

Out here past the muck and brine,
I wait beneath the power lines And now its half past nine
He's never been this late before

Crayfish will do as they wish
Cattails beyond the pale
Hide the reason why he's late

I almost can't blame him I may have done the same
And would expect to pay when caught on someone else's claim

Crayfish will do as they wish with every inch of him.
