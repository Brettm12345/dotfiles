Sleep, like a pillow
Downward, there
Where she won't plan
Anywhere

Soft, as a willow
Touch her, there
Where she won't dare
Somewhere

Sleep, like a marble
Soldier, then
Think like you could
Control it

Sleep, you're in trouble
She's not square
Soft like there's silk
Everywhere

Sleep, goes a willow
Downside, and
Where she won't dare
Anywhere

Look, in the mirror
She's not there
Where she won't care
Somewhere
