As the darkness creeps over the northern mountains of Norway
And the silence reach the woods, I awake and rise
Into the night I wander, like many nights before
And like in my dreams, but centuries ago

Under the moon, under the trees
Into the infinity of darkness
Beyond the light of a new day
Into the frozen nature chilly
Beyond the warmth of the dying sun
Hear the whispering of the wind, the shadows calling

I gaze into the moon which grants me visions
These twelve full moon nights of the year
And for each night the light of the holy disciples fades away

Weaker and weaker, one by one

Weaker and weaker, one by one

I gaze into the moon which makes my mind pure as crystal lakes
My eyes cold as the darkest winter nights
By yet there is a flame inside

It guides me into the dark shadows beyond this world
Into the infinity of thoughts, thoughts of upcoming reality

In the name of the almighty Emperor
I will ride the lands in pride

Carrying the black sword at hand, in warfare

I will grind my hatred upon the loved ones
Despair will be brought upon
The hoping children of happiness

Wherever there is joy the hordes of the eclipse
Will pollute sadness, sadness and hate

Under the reign of fear

The lands will grow black
There is no sunrise yet to come
Into the wastelands of phantoms lost

The lands will grow black
There is no sunrise yet to come

May these moments under the moon be eternal
May the infinity haunt me in darkness
