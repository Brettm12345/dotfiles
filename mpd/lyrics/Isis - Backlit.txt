Always object
Never subject

Can you see us? Are we there?
Are we there...
Can you see me? We are watching
We are watching...

You are fading...
In the daylight...
Fading...

Always upon you, light never ceases
Lost from yourself, light never ceases
Thousands of eyes, gaze never ceases
Light is upon you 'til life in you ceases
