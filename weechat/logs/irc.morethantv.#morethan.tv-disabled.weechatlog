2018-12-13 18:45:02	brett12345	Hi I used to be staff on this tracker
2018-12-13 18:45:08	brett12345	I was a dev for a while

2018-12-13 18:46:49	@MrWhite	whats the reason for the absence?
2018-12-13 18:47:17	brett12345	I was a dev in october 2015 I think
2018-12-13 18:47:45	brett12345	I stopped torrenting tv shows for a while. I really stopped watching stuff that wasn't availible on netflix
2018-12-13 18:48:06	@MrWhite	what sort of dev work did you do?
2018-12-13 18:48:06	brett12345	I've gotten into anime recently and I've been downloading a lot from public trackers
2018-12-13 18:48:26	brett12345	I made the script that handled automatic downloads from other trackers and uploaded them to the site
2018-12-13 18:49:16	brett12345	It used regular expressions to process the name, the quality, etc and connected to the imdb and tvdb api to get the images 
2018-12-13 18:49:20	brett12345	And the other info
2018-12-13 18:49:25	@MrWhite	ok, your well over the cut off to be re activated but maybe the admins wil llet you back in due to prev work

2018-12-13 18:51:31	brett12345	I was working mostly with lazx but I saw the news post about how he was removed from the tracker
2018-12-13 18:51:45	@MrWhite	yes he is long gone
2018-12-13 18:51:58	@MrWhite	but we are recruiting devs
2018-12-13 18:52:22	@MrWhite	just depends on what grounds you left the site

2018-12-13 18:52:59	brett12345	I'm not amazing with the gazzele framework but I work as a javascript dev and I also know bash, python, go, etc.

2018-12-13 18:56:17	brett12345	I'm relying on the bonus point system
2018-12-13 18:56:30	@America	brett12345, do you watch 4k television shows?
